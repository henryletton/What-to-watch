Joint project between Henry Letton and Maxwell Leonardi. The aim is to build an app to settle those "what do we watch" group disputes. Using the catalogue of films currently on Netflix, groups can suggest and vote on films.

## Usage

The tool is hosted [on Heroku](https://what-to-watch-main.herokuapp.com/, "What to watch app"). To start using the app, register a username by simply entering a username with the "New" radio button selected and enter a group name. The group name needs to be the same for the group who is using the app (it is used to determine group film choice and ratings).

There are 3 main pages. The initial page is where films can be searched for and rated. Search for a film you want to suggest watching then click "Yes, looks rad!". This film will then be saved in the group choices for others in the group to vote on. The suggestions below the search show films that others in your group have rated, otherwise it is a random film.

The other 2 pages show the films you have voted on in "Your Preferences" and the complete list of films voted on by anyone in the group, alongside the average rating in "Group Preferences"
